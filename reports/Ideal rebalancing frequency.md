# What is the ideal rebalancing frequency? 

In [SS_1 Report](https://github.com/TheProfitPilgrim/MF_Backtest_app/blob/main/reports/Report%20ss_1.md), the Annual or No rebalancing frequencies seemed to give the maximum returns. But this is far from conclusive - there are numerous rebalancing frequencies (like 18 or 24 months) that can be tested out between rebalancing once in 12 months and not rebalancing at all. 

This document considers 3 additional rebalancing frequencies,  18, 24 and 36 months,  apart from the original four - 3, 6 and 12 months and No rebalance
